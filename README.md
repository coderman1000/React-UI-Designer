# React UI Designer

React UI Designer is a Next.js application designed to help developers create and design UI components for their React.js applications. The app provides a toolbox with draggable items such as grids, tables, boxes, and images, which can be placed on a designer surface. Users can resize these items and adjust their properties through a properties panel.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop:** Easily drag UI components from the toolbox and drop them onto the designer surface.
- **Resizable Components:** Resize components directly on the designer surface.
- **Properties Panel:** Adjust properties of selected components, such as width and height.
- **Snap to Grid:** Automatically snap components to a grid for precise placement.
- **Persistent Layout:** Save the layout of the components to local storage and load them on subsequent visits.
